# RSVP Movies Case Study

In this case study we analyse the past project trends of RSVP productions and provide them insights on their upcoming project. SQL has been extensively used for the analysis of the entire data set.

Further, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are written in the script attached.
